Repo contains 3 notebooks, which preprocess and then plot global temperature observations and projections from CMIP6 models. AA_plotting.ipynb and AA_uncertainty_analysis.ipynb produce all numerical values and figures in the paper. preprocess_tas.ipynb runs a script to preprocess CMIP6 data from the CEDA archive into .csv files (stored in int_outputs/) which contain timeseries of arctic and global mean temperature.
